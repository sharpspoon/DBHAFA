abstract = {Cloud computing paradigm stops short in its offerings towards deployment of latency-critical and bandwidth-intensive applications. Fog computing paradigm emerged as a promising solution to realize deployment of large scale IoT environments and low latency real-time services, leveraging large number of resource-constrained, heterogeneous fog nodes distributed across vast geographical areas and located closer to users and data sources, as compared to core cloud which is usually located at large data centers, far from users and IoT devices. To facilitate efficient deployment of services on the fog infrastructure, we propose Hierarchical and Autonomous Fog Architecture (HAFA) to organize heterogeneous fog nodes into a multi-layered connected hierarchy based on several parameters such as physical location, distance from IoT devices and/or users, node resource configuration, privacy and security. Fog nodes are grouped to facilitate resource pooling and local control, and groups of fog nodes are linked to facilitate disaster readiness and autonomy. HAFA helps reducing effort in finding an optimal node with required resource characteristics towards service deployment.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},
